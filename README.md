# iotdm-robot

To use these tests, you'll need to install the robotframework and Requests library via:

```$ pip install robotframework```
```$ pip install requests```

To run the tests, type from the shell:

```$ pybot iotdm-mini.tsv```

This will output three files:

* log.html
* output.xml
* report.html

On OSX, you can easily view the report.html file via the command:

```$ open report.html```
